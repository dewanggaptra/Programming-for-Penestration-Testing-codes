# Programming-for-Penestration-Testing-codes
Some of my programming for pentest assignment and project code
The automaticsqlinjection.py code automatically runs sql injection to a vulnerable website (the code was made to sql inject a vulnerable website made for our assignment).
The revershell.py code acts like a backdoor to a spesific victim with specific ip address and port number that we want to connect the victim through so that we can run command on their system and send the results of those commands to our system.
